# This file lists suppressions to hide valgrind errors in libraries we don't
# control. Be careful adding to it, since overly-broad suppressions may hide
# real errors in Wireshark!
#
# This is primarily targeted towards the set of libraries on the fuzz-bot (which
# runs a valgrind step) but other entries are welcome as long as they are
# sufficiently commented.

# Zlib 1.2.3.4 on the buildbot hits an uninitialized jump on the first call to
# inflateReset2. According to the Zlib changelog this was fixed in 1.2.3.7.
